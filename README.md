# Digital Certificate Management Using Blockchain

This innovative application seamlessly merges the ServiceNow platform with Blockchain technology, offering a robust solution for companies and recruiters to verify the authenticity of certificates issued by students. Additionally, it empowers government agencies to efficiently reimburse students who have completed short-term certification courses.

Our technology stack features Javascript, the Now Platform, Solidity, and Node JS. Unfortunately, due to the project's participation in a Servicenow hackathon and the private nature of the project code, a detailed explanation is not available. However, a concise video overview is provided below for a glimpse into the project's functionality and objectives.
